I am a third year PhD student in Computer Science at Yale University, advised by [Prof. David van Dijk](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/david-vandijk/). I am also currently working as a part-time Student Researcher at Google under the supervision of [Dr. Bryan Perozzi](https://research.google/people/bryan-perozzi/). I work on building foundational models for large-scale biological data, with an emphasis on large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs).

Before joining Yale, I worked as an undergraduate research student at the University of Houston, Rice University, and Houston Methodist. My previous work included developing spatiotemporal GNNs for timeseries forecasting and vision-language models for medical images. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Houston in 2022.
